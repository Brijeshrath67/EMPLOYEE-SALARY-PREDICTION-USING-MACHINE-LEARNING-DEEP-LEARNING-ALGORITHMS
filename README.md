# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction

This project is a machine learning web app that predicts whether an employee earns **more than 50K** or **less than or equal to $50K** per year based on personal and professional attributes such as age, education, occupation, and working hours.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict income classes (<=50K or >50K) using the **Adult Census Income Dataset**. This is a binary classification problem widely used in predictive modeling.
